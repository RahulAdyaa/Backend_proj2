BCRYPT:
bcrypt is a password-hashing function designed for secure storage of passwords. It is widely used in web applications to securely hash user passwords before storing them in a database. bcrypt is based on the Blowfish cipher and is designed to be slow and computationally expensive to thwart brute-force attacks.
