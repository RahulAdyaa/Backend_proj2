BCRYPT:
bcrypt is a password-hashing function designed for secure storage of passwords. It is widely used in web applications to securely hash user passwords before storing them in a database. bcrypt is based on the Blowfish cipher and is designed to be slow and computationally expensive to thwart brute-force attacks.


JWT:

JWT (JSON Web Token) is a compact, secure way to transmit information between two parties (e.g., a client and a server) as a JSON object. It is commonly used for authentication and secure data exchange.


JWT is actually a bearer token
