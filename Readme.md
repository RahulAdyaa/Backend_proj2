   #BACKEND WITH RAHUL

  # Backend System

This is a general backend system project built with **Node.js** and **Express**. It implements basic functionalities like **authentication**, **JWT-based authorization**, and **secure password hashing**.

## Features
- **JWT Authentication**: Secure token-based authentication.
- **bcrypt**: Password hashing for secure user credentials.
- **Async/Await**: Proper handling of asynchronous operations.
- **Middleware**: Setup for request logging and handling.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have **Node.js** installed on your machine.

### Installation
1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/RahulAdyaa/Backend-System.git



#MY LEARNINGS ->
Database se jab bhi baat kro , async await lagao 
hamesha errors aayengi while talking with databse , so use try catch or promises

app.use tab use krte hain jab hame koi middlewares ya koi sonfig settings krni hain


BCRYPT:
bcrypt is a password-hashing function designed for secure storage of passwords. It is widely used in web applications to securely hash user passwords before storing them in a database. bcrypt is based on the Blowfish cipher and is designed to be slow and computationally expensive to thwart brute-force attacks.


JWT:

JWT (JSON Web Token) is a compact, secure way to transmit information between two parties (e.g., a client and a server) as a JSON object. It is commonly used for authentication and secure data exchange.


JWT is actually a bearer token
